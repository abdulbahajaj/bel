# Bel [Under construction]
The aim of this project is to have an efficient and usable implementation of Bel. This project will attempt to stricktly implement Bel and only deviate when necessary for efficiency or ease of use purposes. The deviations will be listed and documented.

## Contribution policy
At the moment no contributions will be accepted because I am still implementing the basic architecture. However, after that is done I will create clearly defined tasks and accept contributions
