# Bel [Under construction]
The aim of this project is to build a language that a hacker would love to use.

## Philosophy

### Lisp
Lisp is enables hackers to express their ideas easily and concisely. It increase
the paste at which hackers can tinker with ideas, prototype and build beautiful
software. That is why we choose Bel to be the basis for our
language. Bel is a dialect of lisp developed by Paul Graham which the intent of
making lisp even easier to write. See references for more information.

### Ease of mastery
A good language is a language that is easy to learn and master. Afterall, how
good is a language that requires a decade of experience for you to become
somewhat good at it? Bel is designed to be really easy to learn. We do that by
minimizing its features and add those features that are absolutely necessary.
You should be able to become an expert in Bel in less than a year.

### Concurrency and distributed computing

### Efficiency

### Interoperability

### Good documentation

### Testing and support
