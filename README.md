# Bel [Under construction]
The aim of this project is to build a language that a hacker would love to use.

## Philosophy

### Lisp
Lisp enables hackers to express their ideas easily and concisely. It increase
the paste at which hackers can tinker with ideas, prototype and build beautiful
software. This is why we chose Bel to be the basis for our
language. Bel is a dialect of lisp developed by Paul Graham with the intent of
making lisp even easier to write. See the references section for more information.

### Ease of mastery
A good language is easy to master. Afterall, how good is a language that requires a decade of your 
life to become somewhat good at? Bel is designed to be really easy to learn. We achieve that by only adding the features 
that are absolutely necessary.
You will be able to become a Bel expert in less than a year.

### Concurrency and distributed computing

### Efficiency

### Interoperability

### Good documentation

### Testing and support
